      <div class="name">Pig Game</div>
      <div class="desc">
        <p>Pig is a classic dice game that offers a blend of luck and strategic decision-making. The game is played with a single die and the goal is to be the first player to reach 100 points. On each turn, players roll the die, accumulating points by adding the numbers rolled. However, if a player rolls a "1," they lose all the points accumulated during that turn and their turn ends. The game presents an interesting dilemma: do players take a risk and continue rolling to amass more points or do they play it safe and stop to secure their current score? This risk-reward dynamic adds excitement and tension to each round, making Pig an engaging and entertaining game for all ages.</p>
